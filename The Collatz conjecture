/*

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics named after Lothar Collatz. 
It can be summarized as follows. Take any positive integer n. 
If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. 
Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, 
you will always eventually reach 1.
